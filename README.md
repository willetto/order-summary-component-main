## Overview

This was my first Frontend Mentor Project after a short break, so I started easy. I also have learned Svelte and Sass in the meantime, so I wanted to try to create and deploy this using SvelteKit. Overall, it was a success and I estimated the time it would take me to finish fairly well.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Sass
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library
- CSS Grid
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wasn't familiar with SvelteKit's routing in regards to global styles, but I was able to find [some resources](https://joyofcode.xyz/global-styles-in-sveltekit) and implement a general layout and some CSS global variables.

### Continued development

I was only able to use Sass locally scoped in a Svelte component. I want to figure out how to configure Vite and Svelte kit to have Sass and the Sass variables & mixins woven into the architecture.
